A [prettier](https://prettier.io) plugin to keep json tidy...with context preserved.

## Why Tidy?

`tidy` is a collection of formatters that format your code with minimal intrusion.

There are many "opinionated" formatters out there.
Their selling points is that they take care of formatting your code so that you and your team don't have to.

There are definitely merits in that approach.
However, while it remove the arguing point between you and your team,
and it help keeps your code looks and feel the same,
that approach remove the context of your code and render your code into a nice looking generic blob.

70% of the time that is ok, but the remaining 30% of the time it makes your code harder to read and understand.

`tidy` preserves your intent and cleans up the loose points of your code.
